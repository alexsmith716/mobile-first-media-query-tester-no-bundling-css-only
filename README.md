# mobile-first-media-query-tester-no-bundling-css-only

### Overview:
Testing mobile first media queries. This app is using straight, static html & css. No budling. Uploaded this because I encountered a font sizing difference between this 'basic', styled app and the repo 'css-modules-global-css-test-too'. 'css-modules-global-css-test-too' is loading scss through webpack and the end result, when rendered in the browser, is displaying much larger sized font compared to repo 'css-modules-global-css-test-too'.
